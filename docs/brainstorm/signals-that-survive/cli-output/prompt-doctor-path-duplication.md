You are brainstorming architectural variants for the following task. Do not write code. Do not write a final design. Only produce variants and a recommendation.

# Task

## brain doctor prints the file path twice on parse-error findings

Found while capturing real command output for the v1.40.0 release cover.

`o2b brain doctor` renders a parse-error finding as:

    [ERROR] preference-missing-field: preference missing field: created_at (/vault/Brain/preferences/pref-x.md) (/vault/Brain/preferences/pref-x.md)

The path appears twice: once inside the message text, and once appended by the renderer's `${issue.path ? ` (${issue.path})` : ""}` tail.

NOT a v1.40.0 regression - verified: the render template in src/cli/brain/verbs/doctor.ts is byte-identical to the one at f91a698b (v1.39.0), and the v1.40.0 wave changed only how the parse-error CODE is derived, not the message text. The duplication comes from the doctor wrapping the parse error with the path in the message while also setting the structured `path` field.

Fix direction: the structured field is the one to keep - v1.40.0 established that findings should carry their data as fields rather than in prose, so the message should stop embedding the path rather than the renderer stop appending it. Check the other parse-error kinds (retired-*, and the invalid variants) for the same shape before changing one.

Cosmetic only; no behaviour or exit code is affected.

--- validator comment [claude-dev-agent]:
claude-dev-agent @ 2026-07-27: triage validation pass (operator-directed: link + priority actualization; internal work ranks above external-product integration)
- priority: 2 -> 3.
- verified this run: the duplication is live at src/cli/brain/verbs/doctor.ts:49 - the renderer appends ${issue.path ? ` (${issue.path})` : ""} while the doctor also embeds the path inside issue.message.
- rank rationale: fully specified, anchored, internal, zero external dependency, and the fix direction is already written down. Cosmetic, so not 4 - but nothing on the board is more ready to start.

Conventions:
- The kernel is deterministic. It issues no model calls. Anything that must classify, rank, or gate does so from structural signals or numeric scores.
- Search, classification, ranking and extraction must be language-agnostic. Hardcoded natural-language word lists (stop-words, greetings, keywords, negations) are forbidden in EVERY language.
- Every new flag, argument or configuration key must leave behaviour byte-identical when absent.
- A forward pointer printed to the operator resolves a REGISTERED diagnostic code through the advisory rail (src/cli/advisory-rail.ts, src/core/brain/next-step.ts). Caller-supplied prose is rejected by a build ratchet.
- Findings carry their data as structured fields, not embedded in prose messages.
- The vault is plain Markdown replicated peer-to-peer by Syncthing. There is NO git transport for the vault, and nothing may place a .git directory inside the replicated tree.
- Continuity telemetry is emitted through emitGatedTelemetry (src/core/brain/continuity/emit.ts): gated by a configuration key, fail-open, redaction-passing.

Constraints:
- No fallback that silently does nothing. An error must surface explicitly as an error.
- No stubs, no placeholders, no dead code paths.
- SOLID, KISS, DRY. Anything extractable belongs in a named constant or local.
- Do not add an external service dependency, and do not introduce a new runtime dependency without saying so explicitly as a trade-off.
- Do not change existing public command-line or Model Context Protocol surfaces incompatibly.

# Required output format

Produce exactly 3 distinct architectural variants. For each variant:

### Variant N: <short name>
- **Approach**: 2-3 sentences describing the variant.
- **Trade-offs**: bullet list of pros and cons.
- **Complexity**: small | medium | large
- **Risk**: low | medium | high

After the three variants, add exactly one recommendation:

### Recommended: Variant N
**Rationale**: 2-3 sentences explaining why this variant over the others, considering the project context and constraints above.

Output nothing outside of these sections.
